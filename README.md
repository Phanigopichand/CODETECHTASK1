#OVERVIEW OF THIS PROJECT 
*Project Goal:*

* To create a simple Python program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a user based on their weight and height.
* To categorize the BMI into different weight classifications (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).

*Key Features:*

* *User Input:* 
    * Prompts the user to enter their weight in kilograms.
    * Prompts the user to enter their height in meters.
* *BMI Calculation:*
    * Uses the standard BMI formula: BMI = weight (kg) / height (m) ^ 2 
    * Implements the calculation within a dedicated function (calculate_bmi) for better code organization.
* *BMI Categorization:*
    * Determines the BMI category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese) based on the calculated BMI value.
    * Uses a separate function (get_bmi_category) for this logic.
* *Output:*
    * Displays the calculated BMI value to two decimal places.
    * Displays the corresponding BMI categOry

*Benefits of Using Python:*

* *Readability:* Python's syntax is known for its simplicity and readability, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
* *Modularity:* The use of functions (calculate_bmi, get_bmi_category) improves code organization and reusability.
* *Flexibility:* Python is a versatile language that can be easily extended for more complex tasks, such as:
    * Integrating with a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
    * Connecting to databases to store user data.
    * Implementing more advanced machine learning algorithms for personalized health recommendations.

This project serves as a basic example of how to use Python for data processing and simple decision-making. It can be further enhanced to create a more comprehensive health monitoring tool.
